# Covid_RFC_Model
A Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model to predict the Covid Transmission Levels in a population.

The Jupyter Notebook(s) uploaded in this repository contains code for:

-Extracting data from covidactnow.org for analysis

-Observing the transmission levels in the population based on the data

-Cleaning and Wrangling the data

-Creating the model (RFC) and Fitting the Model with the modified data

-Fine tuning the parameters through cross-validation (GridSearchCV)

There are two notebooks in this repository, one that is simply code, and the other being an execution of said code.
